        <h2>About Sam Kissner</h2>
        <p>Sam is not only a great brother and friend, but is also a musician, writer, martial artist and software developer. He was born on December 28, 1989 along with his brother, Daniel Kissner, who is currently designing this page. 
            Sam had a mostly uneventful childhood, performing well in school.  As a boy, he began pursuing some of his major interests.  He began learning Tae Kwon Do, and practiced hard enough to pursue more prestigious belts.  He eventually would go on to compete in tournaments, and brought home many trophies.  He also began learning the piano and guitar, which he continues to play for this day.
            During High School he met his girlfriend, and they began dating in 2008.  They have been together ever since.  They recently bought a house together in June 2023, where they live with their cat Claire.  
            Sam attended the University of Nebraska Omaha, where he received his Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry.  He then returned to the institution to pursue his Master’s degree in Computer Science, which he has since completed.  He works from home as a software developer.
            Sam, much like the rest of his family, is an introvert and a homebody.  He enjoys reading, pursuing various creative outlets such as writing and music, as well as watching television and films.  He also enjoys practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and running, though he can’t exert himself as much as he did as a child due to the wear and tear it produces on his body.  Truly, Sam is an inspiration to us all.
